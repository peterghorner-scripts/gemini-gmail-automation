 *
 * @fileoverview
 * This Google Apps Script uses the Gemini AI to automatically process new emails in Gmail.
 * It identifies emails that require a direct response, ignores notifications and marketing,
 * and applies Gmail labels ('To Respond' and 'Processed') to help you manage your inbox.
 *
 * --- INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ---
 *
 * **Part 1: Initial Setup**
 *
 * 1.  **Create the Script:**
 * - Go to script.google.com and create a new project.
 * - Name your project (e.g., "AI Email Assistant").
 * - Copy and paste the ENTIRE content of this file into the `Code.gs` editor.
 *
 * 2.  **Configure the Manifest File:**
 * - In the editor, click the 'Project Settings' ‚öôÔ∏è icon on the left.
 * - Check the box "Show 'appsscript.json' manifest file in editor".
 * - Return to the 'Editor' üìù view. You will now see the `appsscript.json` file.
 * - Delete the contents of that file and replace it with the provided `appsscript.json` code.
 *
 * 3.  **Get Your Gemini API Key:**
 * - Go to Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/
 * - Click "Get API key" and then "Create API key in new project".
 * - Copy the generated API key. KEEP THIS KEY PRIVATE LIKE A PASSWORD.
 *
 * 4.  **Store Your API Key Securely:**
 * - In the script (`Code.gs`), find the `setupScriptProperties()` function.
 * - Replace "PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with the API key you just copied.
 * - Save the script (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S).
 * - From the function dropdown menu at the top, select `setupScriptProperties` and click "Run".
 * - You will be asked to authorize the script. Follow the prompts to allow it.
 * - After it runs successfully, it's a good security practice to remove your key from the code.
 *
 * 5.  **Create Gmail Labels:**
 * - In your Gmail account, manually create two new labels:
 * - `Processed`
 * - `To Respond`
 * - (Note: The script will create these for you if they don't exist, but it's good practice to set them up first).
 *
 *
 * **Part 2: Running the Script**
 *
 * 1.  **Manual Run:**
 * - To test the script, select the `processInbox` function from the dropdown menu and click "Run".
 * - Check the Execution Log at the bottom of the screen to see its progress.
 *
 * 2.  **Automated Run (Trigger):**
 * - To have the script run automatically, click the 'Triggers' ‚è∞ icon on the left.
 * - Click "+ Add Trigger" in the bottom right.
 * - Set up the trigger with the following settings:
 * - Choose which function to run: `processInbox`
 * - Select event source: `Time-driven`
 * - Select type of time-based trigger: `Hour timer` (or your preferred frequency)
 * - Select hour interval: `Every hour`
 * - Click "Save". The script will now run automatically in the background.

    Analyze the following email and determine if it requires a direct response from me. Your output must be a single JSON object with one key:
- "requiresResponse": a boolean (true or false).

Set "requiresResponse" to true ONLY if the email meets one of the following criteria:
1. It is a direct, personal message specifically addressed to me that asks a question.
2. It is a direct request for a specific deliverable or a task that I am personally responsible for.
3. It explicitly needs my review, approval, or a decision from me.
4. It is a message I initiated and is now pending my next response.

Set "requiresResponse" to false in all other cases, including but not limited to:
1. Automated notifications, system-generated emails, or transactional messages (e.g., file access requests, comment threads, purchase receipts).
2. All Google Calendar updates, meeting invitations, and confirmations.
3. Broad announcements, mass newsletters, marketing, promotional emails, or general invitations to events.
4. Informational notes that do not ask for a reply, such as "thank you" messages or "for your information" updates.
5. Emails with a general call to action that is not a direct request to me (e.g., "register now," "sign up here," "view our latest blog post").
6. Messages where I am CC'd for informational purposes and my action is not required.
